My name is Guilherme dos Santos Korol, I'm a Ph.D. Student in the [Computer Science](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/ppgc/) program at the [Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul](http://www.ufrgs.br/ufrgs/inicial) (UFRGS) in Brazil. I work at the [LSE](http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/lse/) research group under the supervision of Professor [Antonio Beck](http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~caco/). As of September 2022, I'm also a visiting Ph.D. student at the [Chair for Compiler Construction](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/ccc-about) at the Computer Science Department of the [TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/?set_language=en) under the supervision of Professor [Jeronimo Castrillon](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/ccc-staff-castrillon).

My research areas are **Computer Architecture**, **Reconfigurable Computing**, and **Machine Learning**. Currently, my work targets efficient execution of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) on FPGAs. I investigate how optimization methods like pruning, quantization, and approximate computing can be leveraged to improve the FPGA execution of DNNs - especially under constrained environments like the Edge.

### *More about me:*

I received my BSc. in Computer Engineering from the [Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul](https://www.pucrs.br/) (PUCRS) in 2018. I also took classes abroad at the [University of Colorado at Denver](https://www.ucdenver.edu/) (CU Denver) for three terms during undergraduation. After that, I joined the [Microelectronics](http://www.ufrgs.br/pgmicro) program at UFRGS, where I got my MSc degree in 2020 (on general-purpose reconfigurable computing).

Before all that, I have worked as an electronic technician for a few companies before focusing on research. Then, as an undergrad student, I took part in my first research project as a research intern at the [Capitol Technology University](https://www.captechu.edu/) (Laurel/MD) at the end of my exchange at CU Denver. This project was a partnership with NASA's [Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/about/index.html). After that, I worked on a few other research projects, like designing a full-VHDL CNN accelerator for my final bachelor project, before starting my Masters's.
