### *About us*

Rede DAMA (Dinâmica Ambiental da Mata Atlântica- Atlantic Forest Environmental Dynamics) is a network of researchers united to understand the complex dynamics of the Atlantic Forest, one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet.

### *Our goal*

The project aims to strengthen and expand cooperation between national and international scientists focused on investigating how the Atlantic Forest responds to climate change, as well as assessing the impacts of these responses on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The core objective is to deepen our understanding of how tropical forests, rich in biodiversity, react to climatic anomalies and to determine the factors influencing tree mortality, recruitment, and growth within this ecosystem. Through collaboration, Rede DAMA seeks to generate knowledge that can support conservation strategies and inform policy decisions for the sustainable management of this critical biome.

### *Context of our group*

The forests of the Atlantic Forest are among the most diverse on the planet. Additionally, approximately 70% of Brazil’s population lives within the Atlantic Forest biome and relies on the many services provided by its forests, such as water supply, slope stabilization, carbon storage, climate regulation, and pollination, among others. Despite the critical importance of this biome, we still know very little about how these forests—particularly their biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide—are responding to climate change. Understanding how global changes are affecting the Atlantic Forest depends on:

1-Long-term studies in permanent forest plots that allow us to track the trajectories of different species and biological communities and their responses to extreme climate events;

2-The collection and integration of data from permanent plots across the Atlantic Forest and;

3-The strengthening and integration of the scientific community throughout the various regions of the biome.

Our academic cooperation proposal seeks to strengthen a network of researchers and international institutions centered in Brazil to promote understanding of the impact of global changes on tree species and ecosystem functioning in the Atlantic Forest.
