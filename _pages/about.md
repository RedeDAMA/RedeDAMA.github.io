My name is Guilherme dos Santos Korol, I'm a Ph.D. Student in the [Computer Science](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/ppgc/) program at the [Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul](http://www.ufrgs.br/ufrgs/inicial) (UFRGS) in Brazil. I work at the [LSE](http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/lse/) research group under the supervision of Professor [Antonio Beck](http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~caco/).

Currently, my work targets efficient execution of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) on FPGAs. I investigate how optimization methods like pruning and quantization at the algorithmic level and methods at the hardware level like approximate computing can be leveraged to improve the FPGA execution of DNNs - especially under constrained environments like the Edge.

### **More about me:**

I received my BSc. in Computer Engineering from the [Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul](https://www.pucrs.br/) (PUCRS) in 2018. During my undergradion, I also took classes abroad at the [University of Colorado at Denver](https://www.ucdenver.edu/) (CU Denver) for three terms. After that, I joined the [Microelectronics](http://www.ufrgs.br/pgmicro) program at UFRGS, where I got my MSc degree in 2020 (on general purpose reconfigurable computing).

Before all that, I have worked as an electronic technician for a few companies before focusing on research. Then, as an undergrad student, I took part in my first research project as a research intern at the [Capitol Technology University](https://www.captechu.edu/) (Laurel/MD) at the end of my exchange at CU Denver. This project was a partnership with NASA's [Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/about/index.html). After that, I have worked on a few other research projects before starting my Masters's, like developing a full-VHDL CNN accelerator for my final undergrad project.
