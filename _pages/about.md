My name is Guilherme dos Santos Korol, I'm a Ph.D. Student in the [Computer Science](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/ppgc/) program at the [Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul](http://www.ufrgs.br/ufrgs/inicial) (or UFRGS). I work at the [LSE](http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/lse/) research group under the supervision of professor [Antonio Beck](http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~caco/).

## More about me:

I received my BSc. in Computer Engineering from the [Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul](https://www.pucrs.br/) in 2018. During my undergrad studies, I also took classes at the [University of Colorado at Denver](https://www.ucdenver.edu/) for three terms. After that, I joined the [Microelectronics](http://www.ufrgs.br/pgmicro) program at UFRGS, where I got my MSc degree in 2020.

I have worked as an electronic technician for a few companies before focusing on research. Then, I took part in my first research project as a research intern at the [Capitol Technology University](https://www.captechu.edu/) (Laurel/MD). This project was a partnership with NASA's [Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/about/index.html). After that, I have worked on a few others research projects before starting my Masters's degree. See more details and a full list [here](https://gkorol.github.io/projects/).
