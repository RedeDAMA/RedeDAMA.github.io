### A Resource-Aware Multicore CGRA Architecture for Edge Applications

Project carried out during my [Mater's Thesis](https://www.lume.ufrgs.br/handle/10183/213181) under supervision of professor Antonio Carlos Beck and Marcelo Brandalero. In this work, we have investigated methods to make Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architectures (CGRA) more power-efficient. In particular, we explore power-gating and runtime profilers to adapt the reconfigurable fabric to the running applications, avoiding underutilization of the hardware and increasing efficiency. *This project was also selected as Best Poster at the DAC 2020 Young Fellow Program*.

### A FPGA parameterizable multi-layer architecture for CNNs

Work done as my final undergraduate project under supervision of professor Fernando Gehm Moraes at PUCRS. VHDL implementation of a parameterizable FPGA-based CNN accelerator. Processing Element is based on accumulators and an adder tree. We used AlexNet as a case study for this project. Besides the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8862024), more detailed information about this work can be found [here](https://www.inf.pucrs.br/moraes/docs/tcc/tcc_korol.pdf).

### A Lightweight Open Source Command and Control Center and its Interface to Cubesat Flight Software

Project carried out during my internship at CapTech/NASA in 2015. The work was presented at the 2015 Workshop on Spacecraft Flight Software (FSW-15) and the paper can be found [here](https://archive.org/details/ALightweightOpenSourceCommandAndControlCenterAndItsInterfaceToCubesats). The Command and Control Center was implemented with several open source software packages. It interfaced with a Raspberry Pi based cubesats. The open source COSMOS software from Ball Aerospace was used. The received telemetry was put up on a web page. Limits alerts were texted to a user's phone. NASA is looking at this approach to support its own Cubesat Missions.
