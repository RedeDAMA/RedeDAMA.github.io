Project carried out during my [Mater's Thesis](https://www.lume.ufrgs.br/handle/10183/213181) under supervision of professor Antonio Carlos Beck and Marcelo Brandalero. In this work, we have investigated methods to make Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architectures (CGRA) more power-efficient. In particular, we explore power-gating and a runtime profiler to adapt the reconfigurable fabric to the running applications, avoiding underutilization of the hardware and increasing efficiency.


### A FPGA parameterizable multi-layer architecture for CNNs

<img src=https://gkorol.github.io/images/tcc.png alt="Conv. layer" style="float: right; height: 150px; width:350px;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work done as my final undergraduate project under supervision of professor Fernando Moraes (while at PUCRS). VHDL implementation of a parameterizable CNN accelerator. Processing Element is based on accumulators and an adder tree. Uses AlexNet as a case study. Besides the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8862024), more detailed information about this work can be found [here](https://www.inf.pucrs.br/moraes/docs/tcc/tcc_korol.pdf).
