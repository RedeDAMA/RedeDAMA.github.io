### A Resource-Aware Multicore CGRA Architecture for Edge Applications

Project carried out during my [Mater's Thesis](https://www.lume.ufrgs.br/handle/10183/213181) under supervision of professor Antonio Carlos Beck and Marcelo Brandalero. In this work, we have investigated methods to make Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architectures (CGRA) more power-efficient. In particular, we explore power-gating and runtime profilers to adapt the reconfigurable fabric to the running applications, avoiding underutilization of the hardware and increasing efficiency.

### A FPGA parameterizable multi-layer architecture for CNNs

Work done as my final undergraduate project under supervision of professor Fernando Gehm Moraes at PUCRS. VHDL implementation of a parameterizable FPGA-based CNN accelerator. Processing Element is based on accumulators and an adder tree. We used AlexNet as a case study for this project. Besides the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8862024), more detailed information about this work can be found [here](https://www.inf.pucrs.br/moraes/docs/tcc/tcc_korol.pdf).

I am also co-advising undergrad final projects in our group: 
- on 'FPGA-based Inference for 5G' by Daniel de O. Rubiano (with Prof. Antonio Carlos);
- on 'Multi-Plataform Deep Learning Inference' by Eduardo Guerra (with Prof. Antonio Carlos).
